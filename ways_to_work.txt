Minimalists Setup:
- install linux:
  # Debian / Ubuntu - sudo apt install vim git python3-pip
  # RHEL / Centos - sudo yum install vim git python3-pip
  # if you need ansible, follow up with (all distros) - python3 -m pip install ansible

Windows Minalists Setup:
- install python (everyone should agree to the version)
- install notepad++
- install GitHub Desktop

Standard Setup:
- install GitHub Desktop (https://desktop.github.com/)   # MacOS, Windows
- install python (everyone should agree to the version)  # also consider remove old version of python when you upgrade
- visual studio w/ python plugin > pycharm   # either will work as an IDE, but pycharm ONLY will ever do Python

Other Ideas:
- If you need a full OS to program in (an isolated space)...
    - Oracle Cloud (2 vms free)
    - Oracle Virtual Box (on your local machine make a VM)
    - VMWare Workstation (on your local machine make a VM)
- Check out Jupyter as a replacement to visual studio - https://jupyter.org/
